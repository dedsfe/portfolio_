        <h3>Profile:</h3>
            <p> Motivated and focused, my goal in the field of marketing is to grow and gain new experiences and
            knowledge. I enjoy environments where my dedication and skills are challenged daily.</p>

        <h4>Experiences: </h4>
            <h4>Jan 2021 - Present / Junior/Senior Traffic Manager, GF Engineering - São Paulo </h4>
            <p>As a Traffic Manager, I quickly progressed from Junior to a Senior/Team Lead in just one year, managing
                several professionals. I used artificial intelligence tools like AWS for analytical decision-making. I implemented
                campaigns on platforms like Facebook, Google, and TikTok, reaching over 500,000 people. A key achievement
                was acquiring over 50 clients in one year, managing more than $1M in the company's account. </p>
            <h4>Jan 2019 - Dec 2021 / Marketplace Manager, Vida Nova - São Paulo</h4>
            <p>At the start of my career, I was chosen by a health product company as the Marketplace Manager. In less than
                three months, we had already made $50,000 in sales. By applying strategies learned from international
                courses and using the advertisement tools of the Marketplaces, we developed the store from scratch. By the
                time I left the company, 47% of its profits came from marketplaces.</p>
            <h4>Mar 2023 - Present / Traffic Manager/Freelancer, OdontoForte - São Paulo</h4>
            <p>My first freelance project as a Traffic Manager involved the challenge of acquiring 5 new clients daily for a
                client. Using tools like Google ADS, Facebook ADS, Calendly, ManyChat, Landing Pages, and a sales funnel, we
                are bringing in more than 10 clients per day.</p>
